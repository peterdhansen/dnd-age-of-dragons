### Glory Tenets
Source of Power: Axis of Judgement (what does it mean to be worthy)
1. Equality/Fairness vs Excellence/Individual Worth 
2. The worth of an individual is not inherent but earned. 

1. after death, judgement
2. in order for me to be a conduit of justice, I need to figure out what people deserve in life, to make sure the worthy have what they deserve. 
1. Support those that are worthy
2. Stop those oppressing those who are trying to achieve glory. (removing obstacles)

If someone hasn't earned something, they don't deserve it.
