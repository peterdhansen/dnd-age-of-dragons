### Spell Descriptions
#### Druidcraft
*Transmutation cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:

- You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.
- You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.
- You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.
- You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.

#### Mending
*Transmutation cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (two lodestones)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.

#### Resistance
*Abjuration cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature cloak)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the saving throw. The spell then ends.

#### Shillelagh
*Transmutation cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (mistletoe, a shamrock leaf, and a club or quarterstaff)
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
The wood of a *club* or *quarterstaff* you are holding is imbued with nature's power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn't already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.

#### Entangle
*1st-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.

#### Goodberry
*1st-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sprig of mistletoe)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Up to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can use its action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 hit point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.

The berries lose their potency if they have not been consumed within 24 hours of the casting of this spell.

#### Longstrider
*1st-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dirt)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
You touch a creature. The target's speed increases by 10 feet until the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

#### Snare
*1st-level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** S, M (25 feet of rope, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 8 hours
---
As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.

This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be discerned.

The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell's radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the spell ends.

A restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect ends.

After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is restrained by it.

#### Speak with Animals
*1st-level divination (ritual)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
---
You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the DM's discretion.

#### Animal Messenger
*2nd-level enchantment (ritual)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)
- **Duration:** 24 hours
---
By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as "a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard" or "a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat." You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.

When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn't reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Enhance Ability
*2nd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (fur or a feather from a beast)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You touch a creature and bestow upon it a magical enhancement. Choose one of the following effects; the target gains that effect until the spell ends.

***Bear's Endurance.*** The target has advantage on Constitution checks. It also gains 2d6 temporary hit points, which are lost when the spell ends.

***Bull's Strength.*** The target has advantage on Strength checks, and his or her carrying capacity doubles.

***Cat's Grace.*** The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn't take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn't incapacitated.

***Eagle's Splendor.*** The target has advantage on Charisma checks.

***Fox's Cunning.*** The target has advantage on Intelligence checks.

***Owl's Wisdom.*** The target has advantage on Wisdom checks.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Lesser Restoration
*2nd-level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You touch a creature and can end either one disease or one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.

#### Locate Animals or Plants
*2nd-level divination (ritual)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur from a bloodhound)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Describe or name a specific kind of beast or plant. Concentrating on the voice of nature in your surroundings, you learn the direction and distance to the closest creature or plant of that kind within 5 miles, if any are present.

#### Pass without Trace
*2nd-level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

#### Speak with Plants
*3rd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
---
You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell's area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.

You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.

Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DM's discretion. The spell doesn't enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.

If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.

This spell can cause the plants created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature.
