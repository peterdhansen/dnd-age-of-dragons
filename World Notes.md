# in the beginning
Primordials reigned as only sentients (emerged spontaneously) in reality. Gods came about, and created domains and servants.
Gods organized reality, but still many primoridials. 
Comes into our world. See our races interacting with gods living among them. 
Era of the Dawn War - See a battle between armies lead by draconic. 
	fighting over the center of existence (Prime Material Plane). 
	At the end of the dawn war, [[Tiamat]] was ready to destroy everything. A blast from divinity redirected Tiamat's blast and split reality and sent the majority of draconics and primoridials to an alternate reality.
