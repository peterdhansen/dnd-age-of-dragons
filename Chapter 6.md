- Near cave entrance spouts of steam coming out in random directions. 
- Walls are slick with condensation
- Floors are very muddy (thick morass)
- Trap door in the floor leads to long 100ft spiraling rickety staircase, tied rope in staircase
- Open room with long large window with steam behind it. 
- long hallway with standing water
- magic door opens partway (and will close behind us)
