## Area 1: The Alley
> [!info] Description
> Refuse and rubble obscure the entry to this dark alleyway. Stepping
over an open sewer channel, you find yourself standing in a passage

and general filth.

## Area 2: The Warehouse
> [!info] Description
> A maze of crates fills the warehouse. Rising up to the bare wood rafters,
the crates vary in size and each display an enigmatic brand. Pale violet
light emanates from unseen sources. A small footpath winds its way
among the stacked cargo.

> [!info] Extraction Table
> A long wooden table with leather-strap restraints is bathed in the
violet light of several candle stands. Knives in dark scabbards lay on
its surface, and a peculiar burn mark is found repeated near the collar
restraint at one end. On the floor are two crates showing evidence of
being recently sealed. A parchment is crudely nailed to the table; it
hangs down apron-like from the table’s edge.

- Parchment: unknown language.
	- DC14 Arcana/Investigation: Diagram is a ritual object describing a surgical technique of sorts.

- Crates: DC12 Athl. reveals white powder.

## Area 3: The Room with Five Corners

> [!info] Description
> The view through the doorway into the back room portrays a dizzying
spectacle of nightmare. Beyond the threshold is a plain chamber,
breached along one wall by a geometric impossibility. A fifth corner has
appeared there and yet the shape of the room remains square. Space and
time argue in this place; a precipitation of dread hangs in the air. Pale
figures pass crates into the anomalous corner; unseen hands receive the
grim cargo.

- 2 Scouts with Curse (passing crates. 
- Gang Leader Emit (Priest). 
- 2 Grells hiding in rafters (float down behind the party)
- Gibbering Mouther (enters fight after grells)

## Hooks
> [!cite] Intro
> It’s true I used to run with the Untamed—back when Owl was the
leader. I don’t associate with ’em now, though—not after what I saw.
I got a stomach for all manner of things, but whatever it was I spied
through the door at the back of the hideout. A room with a wall changing
shape—like a puzzle putting itself together—filled me with a kind
of fear I ain’t known before or since. I can’t say what dark thing the
Untamed are up to, but there ain’t a one of ’em casts a shadow no more—
not that you’d see ’em out in sun anyway.
